# Unique Binary Tree Implementation (tm)

This repository is designed for you to showcase your **unique binary tree implementation**™ in **any programming language** or using **any technologies**. Whether it's **Rust**, **COBOL**, **Bash**, or even **SQL** — all kinds of solutions are welcome! Want to create an HTTP server with deployment manifests for Kubernetes or build a full-fledged enterprise implementation? Go for it, nothing is stopping you!

If you feel that your solution has its own charm, feel free to create this implementation as well. Even if an implementation in that language already exists.

There are no strict restrictions here — the only requirement is to leave a `README.md` file in your directory with an explanation of your idea and how to run your implementation.

## Why?

I’m tired of algorithmic sections during job interviews. Why not test real-world skills of candidates instead of writing another implementation of **unique binary tree™** , insertion sort, `${ALGORITHM_NAME}`.

## Project Structure

```
project_root
│
├── programming_language (if multiple languages are used, use "misc" folder)
│   └── your_nickname (heroes should be known!)
│       └── your_code_with_readme.md (explanation of your idea and instructions on running it)
```

### What you need to do:

1. Add your binary tree implementation in your chosen language or technology.
2. Write a `README.md` to help others understand your idea and run your solution.
3. Don't limit yourself — be creative!
